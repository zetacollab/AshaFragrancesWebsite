              <h1><em> Who are we?</em></h1><br>
                We are the group of farmers who believes that excessive use of Chemical Fertilizers and pesticides is too harmful for human beings because the produce becomes toxic...
                Moreover excessive use of chemical fertilizers pollutes the ground water too and it equally harmful for other Animals and birds too..
                Overall due to use of hazardous chemicals slowly and gradually our age is decreasing.
              <h1><em>What we do??</em></h1>
                We are doing integrated farming..because you will must agree that Animal husbandry and organic farming is directly depending on each other..
                Because green manure or you can say organic compost can only be prepare through Animal waste which is really useful for soil health and without improving soil health you can't expect nutritious and toxin free foods..
                 Our promoters have faced cancer patients in there family and during the gray period of there life they have discovered that only toxic foods are responsible for most of the cancer mostly "gastrointestinal" cancer..
                Though we have decided to make our India a country of herbal produces and initiated the platform  <b>"जैविक बाजार "</b> Welcome in our family of organic farmers and food lovers..
